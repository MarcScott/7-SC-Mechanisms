- A mechanism is a device that takes an input motion or force and outputs a different motion or force.
- Gears, for instance, are a type of mechanism.

- In this project you're going to be looking at different types of Cam.

- Cam mechanisms turn rotary motion (round and round) into reciprocating motion (back and forth)

- There are many different types of Cam.

- A cam mechanism is made up of three parts: cam, slide and follower.
- The cam rotates continually. The follower is a rod that rests on the edge of the turning cam.
- The follower moves up and down, but can't move to the side because of the slide or guide.
- This means the cam follower can only:
  - Rise
  - Fall
  - Dwell
** Badge It - Silver
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- For each of the Cams listed below, use online resources to find animations of them working.
- Using simple the key words above, describe the motion of the followers, driven by these cams.
  1. Pear-shaped cam
  2. Eccentric cam
  3. Drop cam
** Badge It - Gold
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- Using SolidWorks, produce two of the Cams below (Not Eccentric, Round or Ellipse though).
- The Cam's diameter must not exceed 60mm.

- Don't worry about putting the hole in the middle, we'll do that later.
- Screenshot your finished sketches including the part where it states your sketch is fully defined.
** Badge It - Platinum

- SolidWorks can be used to produce animations.
- Independently (or with a little help from your teacher), produce an animation of one of your cams rotating.
