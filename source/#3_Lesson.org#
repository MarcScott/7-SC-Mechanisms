- There are many different forms of energy.
- When you pick up a ball, you give it what is known as Gravitational Potential Energy.
- When you drop it, the Gravitational Potential Energy is converted to Kinetic Energy (movement). In other words, the ball falls.
- Other types of energy are:
  1. Electrical Energy
  2. Nuclear Energy
  3. Thermal Energy (Heat)
  4. Light Energy
  5. Chemical Energy (Fuel)
  6. Elastic Potential Energy. 
  7. Sound Energy

- Certain devices can convert one form of energy to another.
  - A solar panel can convert light energy to electrical energy.
  - A wind turbine converts kinetic energy to electrical energy.
  - A fire convert chemical energy to light and heat energy.
- In this project you can use a motor. An electic motor can convert electrical energy to kinetic energy.

- Describe the energy conversions that happen in the following systems. Use the web to help you.
  1. A Battery
  2. An LED
  3. A Buzzer
  4. A Dynamo
  5. Television.

- An electric motor converts, electrical energy into kinetic energy.
- It achieves this by the use of magnets.
- Look at the diagram below.

- When an electric curret passes through a wire, that is inside a magnetic filed, the wire experiences a force that will move it.
